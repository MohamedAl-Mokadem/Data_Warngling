### twitter data gathering, Wrangling, analyzing and visualizing

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries)

The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
